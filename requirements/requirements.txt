# `CompilationException` is no longer implemented from dbt-core==1.4.0.
# So we have to use dbt-core 1.3 or less, until the subsequent fix is released.
# SEE https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/4317
dbt-core<1.4
setuptools>=65.5.1 # not directly required, pinned by Snyk to avoid a vulnerability
